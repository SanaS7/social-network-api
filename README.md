## Task

For this homework, I have been assigned the task of building an API for a social network web application. The goal is to create an API that enables users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists. To accomplish this, I will be using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) tool. Additionally, I have the option to use a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript `Date` object for formatting timestamps.

Since no seed data is provided, I will need to create my own data using Insomnia after setting up the API.

Since this application will not be deployed, I am required to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the API and showcases the fulfillment of the provided acceptance criteria. I will include the link to the video in the README of my project.

To summarize, the main requirements for the API are as follows:

1. Use MongoDB as the database, considering its speed and flexibility in handling large amounts of data and unstructured data.

2. Utilize Express.js for routing and Mongoose as the ODM tool.

3. Implement functionalities that allow users to perform the following actions:
   - Create, update, and delete users.
   - Create and delete thoughts.
   - React to thoughts.
   - Manage friend lists.

I will now proceed with building the API and documenting its functionality in the walkthrough video.
